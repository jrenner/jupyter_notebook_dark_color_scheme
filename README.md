=============================

dark color schemes for ipython/jupyter

#Installation
-------------

Drop custom.css and custom.js into your profile's static/custom/ directory

i.e.
```
~/.ipython/profile-jrenner/static/custom/
```

#Using custom color schemes on JupyterHub

overwrite the custom.css and custom.js files in your frak/angus/etc `$HOME/.ipython/profile-default/static/custom` directory
Since your are not launching your own notebook server you don't have control over which profile is used
